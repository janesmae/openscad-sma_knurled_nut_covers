# OpenSCAD: SMA knurled nut covers

SMA spinner / knurled nut cover for FPV antennae.
An easy and simple way (without tools) to screw the FPV antennae to transmitter and receiver. The knurled nut cover can be used primarily on the receiver or the FPV video goggles since the antenna is often unscrewed for transport purposes.
